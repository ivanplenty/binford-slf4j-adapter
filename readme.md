The Binford SLF4J Apadter Pack
==============================

Thank you for choosing binford-slf4j.  By default our implementation of slf4j uses the binford-logger concrete implementation.  This is a good start and will give you colorful logs, but the more likely case is you have a favorite logger you want to keep using.  The adapter pack is for you.

If you like using log4js, then this pack already has a wrapper available so you may keep using it.

If you like using another logger, then follow this pack's example to wrap your existing logger.  I think you will it takes more time to read this description than it does to do the work.
